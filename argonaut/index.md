# Argonaut Project

The Argonaut Project's security workgroup is supporting the development of open
specifications for the authorization of clinical apps, and single-sign-on
into clinical apps. To accomplish these goals, Argonaut is working with the
[SMART Health IT](http://smarthealthit.org) team at Boston Children's Hospital
to produce specifications that serve four key use cases:

 * Clinicians using web-based apps to access FHIR resources
 * Clinicians using mobile apps to access FHIR resources
 * Patients using web-based apps to access FHIR resources
 * Patients using mobile apps to access FHIR resources 

# Specs and References

Our specs build on two key open standards:
[OAuth 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
