# Best Practices in Authorization for SMART on FHIR EHRs

This page is designed to catalog best practices in developing secure SMART on
FHIR EHR implementations. As such, these considerations may not directly affect
interoperability, but are likely to affect the level of assurance the server
is able to provide.  These Best Practices are not intended to dictate 
institutional policy, but to offer pracical solutions for making security
decisions to enforce policy. This page is a work in progress.  

## Please contribute suggestions!

Please use the link at the top of this page to suggest additions to our best
practices list.
