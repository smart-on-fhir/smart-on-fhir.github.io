# Scopes and Launch Context

SMART on FHIR's authorization scheme uses OAuth scopes to communicate (and
negotiate) access requirements. In general, we use scopes for three kinds of
data:

1. Clinical data
2. Contextual data
3. Identity data


### Quick Start

Here is a quick overview of the most commonly used scopes. Read on below for complete details.

Scope              | Grants
-------------------|-------
`patient/*.read`   | Permission to read any resource for the current patient (see notes on wildcard scopes below)
`user/*.*`         | Permission to read and write all resources that the current user can access (see notes on wildcard scopes below)
`openid` `profile` | Permission to retrieve information about the current logged-in user
`launch`           | Permission to obtain launch context when app is launched from an EHR
`launch/patient`   | When launching outside the EHR, ask for a patient to be selected at launch time
`offline_access`   | Request a `refresh_token` that can be used to obtain a new access token to replace an expired one, even after the end-user no long is online after the access token rexpires
`online_access`   | Request a `refresh_token` that can be used to obtain a new access token to replace an expired one, and that will be usable for as long as the end-user remains online.


## Scopes for requesting clinical data

SMART on FHIR defines OAuth2 access scopes that correspond directly to FHIR
resource types. We define **read** and **write** permissions for
patient-specific and user-level access.

### Clinical Scope Syntax

Expressed in [EBNF notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form), the clinical scope syntax is:

`clinical-scope ::= ( 'patient' | 'user' ) '/' ( fhir-resource | '*' ) '.' ( 'read' | 'write' | '*' )`

</div>

### Patient-specific scopes

Patient-specific scopes allow access to specific data about a single patient.
(You'll notice that we don't need to say *which* patient here: clinical data
scopes are all about "what" and not "who." We'll deal with "who" below!)
Patient-specific scopes take the form: `patient/:resourceType.(read|write|*)`.

Let's look at a few examples:

Goal | Scope | Notes
-----|-------|-----
Read all observations about a patient | `patient/Observation.read` |
Read demographics about a patient | `patient/Patient.read` | Note the difference in capitalization between "patient" the permission type and "Patient" the resource.
Add new blood pressure readings for a patient| `patient/Observation.write`| Note that the permission is broader than our goal: with this scope, an app can add not only blood pressures, but other observations as well. Note also that write access does not imply read access.
Read all available data about a patient| `patient/*.read`| See notes on wildcard scopes below |

### User-level scopes

User-level scopes allow access to specific data that a user can access. Note
that this isn't just data *about* the user; it's data *available to* that user.
User-level scopes take the form: `user/:resourceType.(read|write|*)`.

Let's look at a few examples:

Goal | Scope | Notes
-----|-------|-----
Read a feed of all new lab observations across a patient population: | `user/Observation.read` |
Manage all appointments to which the authorizing user has access | `user/Appointment.read` `user/Appointment.write` | Note that `read` and `write` both need to be supplied. (Write access does not imply read access.)
Manage all resources on behalf of the authorizing user| `user/*.read` `user/*.write `| Note that the permission is broader than our goal: with this scope, an app can add not only blood pressures, but other observations as well. Also see notes on wildcard scopes below.
Select a patient| `user/Patient.read` | Allows the client app to select a patient

### Wildcard scopes

As noted previously, clients can request clinical scopes that contain a wildcard (`*`) for both the FHIR resource as well as the requested permission for the given resource. When a wildcard is requested for the FHIR resource, the client is asking for all data for all available FHIR resources, both now _and in the future_. This is an important distinction to understand, especially for the entity responsible for granting authorization requests from clients.

For instance, imagine a FHIR server that today just exposes the Patient resource. The authorization server asking a patient to authorize a SMART app requesting `patient/*.read` should inform the user that they are being asked to grant this SMART app access to not just the currently accessible data about them (patient demographics), but also any additional data the FHIR server may be enhanced to expose in the future (eg, genetics).

When a wildcard is requested for the permission, as in the case of `patient/Patient.*`, the client is asking for both read and write access to the FHIR resource.

As with any requested scope, the scopes ultimately granted by the authorization server may differ from the scopes requested by the client! When dealing with wildcard clinical scope requests, this is often true.

As a best practice, clients should examine the granted scopes by the authorization server and respond accordingly. Failure to do so may lead to situations in which the client attempts to access FHIR resources they were not granted access only to receieve an authorization failure by the FHIR server.

For example, imagine a client with the goal of obtaining read and write access to a patient's allergies and as such, requests the clinical scope of `patient/AllergyIntolerance.*`. The authorization server may respond in a variety of ways with respect to the scopes that are ultimately granted. The following table outlines several, but not an exhaustive list of scenarios for this example:

Granted Scope | Notes
--------------|---------------
`patient/AllergyIntolerance.*` | The client was granted exactly what it requested: patient-level read and write access to allergies via the same requested wildcard scope.
`patient/AllergyIntolerance.read`<br />`patient/AllergyIntolerance.write` | The client was granted exactly what it requested: patient-level read and write access to allergies. However, note that this was communicated via two explicit scopes rather than a single wildcard scope.
`patient/AllergyIntolerance.read` | The client was granted just patient-level read access to allergies.
`patient/AllergyIntolerance.write` | The client was granted just patient-level write access to allergies.
`patient/*.read` | The client was granted read access to all data on the patient.
`patient/*.*` | The client was granted its requested scopes as well as read/write access to all other data on the patient.
`patient/Observation.read` | The client was granted an entirely different scope: patient-level read access to the patient's observations. While this behavior is unlikely for a production quality authorization server, this scenario is technically possible.
_none_ | The authoriztion server chose to not grant any of the requested scopes.

As a best practice, clients are encouraged to request only the scopes and permissions they need to function and avoid the use of wildcard scopes purely for the sake of convenience. For instance, if your allergy management app requires patient-level read and write access to allergies, requesting the `patient/AllergyIntolerance.*` scope is acceptable. However, if your app only requires access to read allergies, requesting a scope of `patient/AllergyIntolerance.read` would be more appropriate.

## Scopes for requesting context data

Many apps rely on contextual data from the EHR to answer questions like:

* Which patient record is currently "open" in the EHR?
* Which encounter is currently "open" in the EHR?
* At which clinic, hospital ward, or patient room is the end-user currently working?

To request access to such details, an app asks for "launch context" scopes in
addition to whatever clinical access scopes it needs. Launch context scopes are
easy to tell apart from clinical data scopes, because they always begin with
`launch`.

There are two general approaches to asking for launch context data, depending
on the details of how your app is launched.

### Apps that launch from the EHR

Apps that launch from the EHR will be passed an explicit URL parameter called
`launch`, whose value must be turned into an OAuth scope to bind the app's
authorization request to the current EHR session.  If an app receives the URL
parameter `launch=abc123`, then it requests the scope `launch` and provides an
additional URL parameter of `launch=abc123` That's all.

### Standalone apps

Standalone apps that launch outside the EHR do not have any EHR context at the
outset. These apps must explicitly request EHR context by using the following
scopes:

#### Requesting context with scopes

Requested Scope | Meaning
------|---------|-------------------
`launch/patient` | Need patient context at launch time (FHIR Patient resource)
`launch/encounter` | Need encounter context at launch time (FHIR Encounter resource)
`launch/location` | Need location context at launch time (FHIR Location resource)
(Others)| This list can be extended by any SMART EHR if additional context is required.

### Launch context arrives with your `access_token`

Once an app is authorized, the token response will include any context data the
app requested -- along with (potentially!) any unsolicited context data the EHR
decides to communicate. For example, EHRs may use launch context to communicate
UX and UI expectations to the app (see `need_patient_banner` below).

Launch context parameters come alongside the access token. They will appear as JSON
parameters:

```
{
  access_token: "secret-xyz",
  patient: "123",
  ...
}
```
Here are the launch context paramaters to expect:

Launch context parameter | Example value | Meaning
------|---------|-------------------
`patient` | `"123"`| String value with a patient id, indicating that the app was launched in the context of FHIR Patient 123. If the app has any patient-level scopes, they will be scoped to Patient 123.
`encounter` | `"123"`| String value with an encounter id, indicating that the app was launched in the context of FHIR Encounter 123.
`location` | `"123"`| String value with a location id, indicating that the app was launched from the phyical place corresponding to FHIR Location 123.
`need_patient_banner` | `true` or `false` (boolean) | Boolean value indicating whether the app was launched in a UX context where a patient banner is required (when `true`) or not required (when `false`). An app receiving a value of `false` should not take up screen real estate displaying a patient banner.
`resource` | `"MedicationPrescription/123"`| String value with a relative resource link, describing some specific resource context for the (in this case, a particular medication prescription). This is a generic mechanism to communicate to an app that a particular resource is "of interest" at launch time.
`intent` | `"reconcile-medications"`| String value describing the intent of the application launch (see notes [below](#launch-intent))
`smart_style_url` | `"https://ehr/styles/smart_v1.json"`| String URL where the host's style parameters can be retrieved (for apps that support [styling](#styling))


#### Notes on launch context parameters

<h5 id="launch-intent"><b>App Launch Intent</b> (optional)</h5>
`intent`: Some SMART apps might offer more than one context or user interface
that can be accessed during the SMART launch. The optional `intent` parameter
in the launch context provides a mechanism for the SMART host to communicate to
the client app which specific context should be displayed as the outcome of the
launch. This allows for closer integration between the host and client, so that
different launch points in the host UI can target specific displays within the
client app.

For example, a patient timeline app might provide three specific UI contexts,
and inform the SMART host (out of band, at app configuration time)  of the
`intent` values that can be used to launch the app directly into one of the
three contexts. The app might respond to `intent` values like:

* `summary-timeline-view` - A default UI context, showing a data summary
* `recent-history-timeline` - A history display, showing a list of entries
* `encounter-focused-timeline` - A timeline focused on the currently in-context encounter

If a SMART host provides a value that the client does not recognize, or does
not provide a value, the client app should display a default application UI
context.

Note:  *SMART makes no effort to standardize `intent` values*.  Intents simply
provide a mechanism for tighter custom integration between an app and a SMART
host. The meaning of intents must be negotiated between the app and the host.

<h5 id="styling"><b>SMART App Styling</b> (optional)</h5>
`smart_style_url`: In order to mimic the style of the SMART host more closely,
SMART apps can check for the existence of this launch context parameter and
download the JSON file referenced by the URL value, if provided.

The URL should serve a "SMART Style" JSON object with one or more of the following properties:

```
{
  color_background: "#edeae3",
  color_error: "#9e2d2d",
  color_highlight: "#69b5ce",
  color_modal_backdrop: "",
  color_success: "#498e49",
  color_text: "#303030",
  dim_border_radius: "6px",
  dim_font_size: "13px",
  dim_spacing_size: "20px",
  font_family_body: "Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif",
  font_family_heading: "'HelveticaNeue-Light', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"
}
```

The URL value itself is to be considered a version key for the contents of the SMART Style JSON:
hosts must return a new URL value in the `smart_style_url` launch context parameter if the contents
of this JSON is changed.

Style Property | Description
---------------|-------------
`color_background` | The color used as the background of the app.
`color_error` | The color used when UI elements need to indicate an area or item of concern or dangerous action, such as a button to be used to delete an item, or a display an error message.
`color_highlight` | The color used when UI elements need to indicate an area or item of focus, such as a button used to submit a form, or a loading indicator.
`color_modal_backdrop` | The color used when displaying a backdrop behind a modal dialog or window.
`color_success` | The color used when UI elements need to indicate a positive outcome, such as a notice that an action was completed successfully.
`color_text` | The color used for body text in the app.
`dim_border_radius` | The base corner radius used for UI element borders (0px results in square corners).
`dim_font_size` | The base size of body text displayed in the app.
`dim_spacing_size` | The base dimension used to space UI elements.
`font_family_body` | The list of typefaces to use for body text and elements.
`font_family_heading` | The list of typefaces to use for content heading text and elements.

SMART client apps that can adjust their styles should incorporate the above
property values into their stylesheets, but are not required to do so.

Optionally, if the client app detects a new version of the SMART Style object
(i.e. a new URL is returned the `smart_style_url` parameter), the client can
store the new property values and request approval to use the new values from
a client app stakeholder. This allows for safeguarding against poor usability
that might occur from the immediate use of these values in the client app UI.

## Scopes for requesting identity data

Some apps need to authenticate the clinical end-user. This can be accomplished
by requesting a pair of OpenID Connect scopes: `openid` and  `profile`.

When these scopes are requested (and the request is granted), the app will
receive an [`id_token`](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken)
that comes alongside the access token.

This token must be [validated according to the OIDC specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation).
To learn more about the user, the app should treat the "profile" claim as the URL of
a FHIR resource representing the current user. This will be a resource of type
`Patient`, `Practitioner`, or `RelatedPerson`.

## Scopes for requesting a refresh token

To request a `refresh_token` that can be used to obtain a new access token
after the current access token expires, add one of the following scopes:

Scope              | Grants
-------------------|-------
`online_access`    | Request a `refresh_token` that can be used to obtain a new access token to replace an expired one, and that will be usable for as long as the end-user remains online.
`offline_access`   | Request a `refresh_token` that can be used to obtain a new access token to replace an expired token, and that will remain usable for as long as the authorization server and end-user will allow, regardless of whether the end-user is online. 

## Steps for using an ID token

 1. Examine the ID token for its "issuer" property
 2. Perform a `GET {issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
 3. Fetch the server's JSON Web Key by following the "jwks_uri" property
 4. Validate the token's signature against the public key from step #3
 5. Extract the "profile" claim and treat it as the URL of a FHIR resource

## Worked examples

For worked examples (in Python), see [this ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/smart-on-fhir-jwt-examples.ipynb).

## Appendix: URI representation of scopes

In some circumstances - for example, exchanging what scopes users are allowed to have, or sharing what they did choose), the scopes must be represented as URIs. When this is done, the standard URI is to prefix the SMART scopes with  http://smarthealthit.org/fhir/scopes/, so that a scope would be `http://smarthealthit.org/fhir/scopes/patient/*.read`. 

openID scopes have a URI prefix of http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0#
