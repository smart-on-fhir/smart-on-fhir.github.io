## Supported API operations

The JS client supports the following FHIR API calls:

#### Instance-level operations

* `read`  Read the current state of a given resource
* `vread` Read a specific version of a given resource

#### Type-level operations

* `search` Search for resources of a given type that match a set of filters

For full details on these operations, the FHIR API calls are documented at:
http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/http.html

## Reading a single resource

Instance-level operations in FHIR work with a single resource instance at a
time. Two key operations are `read` and `vread`:

  * `smart.api.Something.read(resourceId)`  Read the current state of a given resource
  * `smart.api.Something.vread(resourceId, versionId)`  Read a sepcific version of a given resource

Just change `Something` to the name of a FHIR resource from [this complete
list](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/resourcelist.html). The
resources you can work with include:

* `AllergyIntolerance`
* `MedicationPrescription`
* `MedicationDispense`
* `Medication`
* `Observation`
* `Patient`
* `Procedure`

## Searching for resources

The most important type-level operation is `search`, which allows you to find
resources of a given type, with a set of filters applied.

To search for resources you'll use either:

 * `smart.api.Something.search()`  when you want to search across patients, or

 * `smart.context.patient.Something.search()` when you only want results for the patient in context.

(Note: in any case your app will only be able to read the data it's
authorized to see -- so you could be lazy and query for "all" the data knowing
that authorization restrictions will limit the data returned. But it's a good
practice to write explicit patient-level queries when that's what you have in
mind, because it will make your intentions more clear -- and make your code
more portable.)

### FHIR Search Parameters

When you perform a FHIR `search` operation, you'll often want to apply filters
to limit the results you get back. For example, you may want to fetch a list of
HbA1c lab results when you're not interested in cholesterol readings.  You can
create an expressive set of filters using FHIR's "search parameters," a set of
constraints passed along as URL parameters. The SMART on FHIR JS client has
built-in support for all search parameters defined in FHIR.

To learn how these work, let's look at an example from the FHIR spec. We'll
examine the `MedicationPrescription` resource.  FHIR [defines a set of search
parameters](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/medicationprescription.html#search)
for this resource (and all other resources) at the bottom of the resource
documentation page. Excerpting from the FHIR spec, we see:

<table class="list">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Name</b>
    </td>
    <td><b>Type</b>
    </td>
    <td><b>Description</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>_id</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#token">token</a>
    </td>
    <td/>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>datewritten</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#date">date</a>
    </td>
    <td>Return prescriptions written on this date</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>encounter</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#reference">reference</a>
    </td>
    <td>Return prescriptions with this encounter identity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>identifier</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#token">token</a>
    </td>
    <td>Return prescriptions with this external identity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>medication</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#reference">reference</a>
    </td>
    <td>Code for medicine or text in medicine name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>patient</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#reference">reference</a>
    </td>
    <td>The identity of a patient to list dispenses for</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>status</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html#token">token</a>
    </td>
    <td>Status of the prescription</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In short, this defines the set of parameters that can be used to search for a
prescription. Each parameter has a name, which is how we refer to it, and a
type, which tells us what kind of operations it supports. For example,
`date`-type search parameters like `datewritten` allow simple date math like:

```
// Written anytime in the year 2014 and still active
smart.api.MedicationPrescription
  .where
  .status("active")
  .datewritten("2014")

// Written between January 2014 and December 2015
smart.api.MedicationPrescription
  .where
  .datewritten(">=2014")
  .datewritten("<2016")
```

These examples raise a few key points:

1. You introduce a set of search filters using the `.where` operation.

2. The FHIR search parameter names are directly translated into JS function
names. To preserve compatibility with JS naming rules, FHIR parameter names
with dashes, like `value-quantity`, are convereted to camel-cased names like
"valueQuantity".

3. Multiple search filters can be chained together. These act like "and"
operations -- so  in the example above, we'll only match prescriptions whose
date was after the beginning of 2014 *and* before the beginning of 2016.

You can also query for  the *or* of two values, also known as a "disjunction".
For example, say you want to find all patients named "John Smith" *or* "Bob
Smith". To search by disjunction, just add `In` to a search parameter name.
This looks like:

```
smart.api.Patient.where
  .givenIn("John", "Bob")
  .family("Smith")
```

(Note: you can pass multiple arguments, or array arguments like
`givenIn(["John", "Bob"])` -- these work identically.
