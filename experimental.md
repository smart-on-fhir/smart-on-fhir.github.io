# Experimental features in SMART

This page documents features of SMART that aren't quite widely deployed or require a bit more attention to make it into the stable version of the SMART specification. These features are subject to change, but have been implemented by some systems. 

## smart-app-styling-properties

The smart_style_url launch parameter provided alongside the access_token in the authorization flow can contain a url with the following json key/value pairs:

```
{
  color_background: "#edeae3",
  color_error: "#9e2d2d",
  color_highlight: "#69b5ce",
  color_modal_backdrop: "",
  color_success: "#498e49",
  color_text: "#303030",
  dim_border_radius: "6px",
  dim_font_size: "13px",
  dim_spacing_size: "20px",
  font_family_body: "Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif",
  font_family_heading: "'HelveticaNeue-Light', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"
}
```

The URL value itself is to be considered a version key for the contents of the SMART Style JSON:
hosts must return a new URL value in the `smart_style_url` launch context parameter if the contents
of this JSON is changed.
