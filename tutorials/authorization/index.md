# Tutorials - Simple Authorization App

## Overview

This tutorial will demonstrate the basic implementation steps to perform SMART on FHIR
OAuth2 authorization and retrieve patient data from
scratch without relying on a specialized SMART on FHIR client. Understanding the 
implementation steps of this mechanism is useful if you are planning on developing
your own SMART on FHIR client or would simply like to gain insight into the SMART on FHIR
authorization protocol. If you would rather start with writing SMART on FHIR apps
as quickly as possible, you can use our Java Script client which handles the
authorization process for you (see [`this tutorial`]({{site.baseurl}}tutorials/javascript)
to learn about the JS client)

## Registering A Client

To run this sample app against [our public sandbox server](https://sandbox.smarthealthit.org), first you will need 
to select two endpoint URLs for your app which will handle the launch and redirect requests. For this tutorial
we decided to use `http://localhost:4000/simple-auth/launch.html` as our launch endpoint and 
`http://localhost:4000/simple-auth/index.html` as our redirect URL. You should configure a web server
to handle these URLs (or the ones that you pick) by serving the two sample pages below. For prototyping, we're partial to [`http-server`](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server) which you can launch via
`http-server -p 4000 /path/to/simple-auth/..`.

Now that you have established the client endpoints for your app, it's time to register your very own
client with the [sandbox server](https://sandbox.smarthealthit.org). If everything is in order, the  server will respond with a Client ID. You should record this, since you will need it to configure your sample app in the next step.

## Sample App

Now that you have successfully registered your client and obtained a Client ID from the sandbox
server, try this sample app, which implements all the basic steps necessary to obtain an authorization
token from the authorization service and then request patient data from the SMART on FHIR API server.
Don't forget to change the Client ID inside the `launch.html` script with the one for your client.

## Launching the Sample App

Log in to the [sandbox server](https://sandbox.smarthealthit.org), launch your app and watch it request authorization and print the patient's name.

## Acting as a confidential client

The demo app above is also capable of acting as a confidential client. In reality,
as an HTML5 app, it has no way of keeping a secret and therefore does not meet the
criteria for a confidential client. Nevertheless, we feel that it is educational to
use it as a pseudo-confidential client to learn about the behavior this class of clients.

To turn the app into a confidential app, register a new app on the sandbox server and choose the app type of "confidential client". Next, set the `clientId` and `secret` in your `launch.html` to match the client. Finally, launch the app to see it behave as if it were confidential.

## Next steps

The sample app that we looked at provides a simple scaffolding for developing a SMART on FHIR
client. Of course, there are a number of nice features that we have omitted for the sake of
simplicity, which we leave as an exercise to the reader. Here are a couple such features:

 * caching of the authorization token and stripping the code and state parameters from
 the app location bar to enable handling of browser refresh events
 * exception handling for the REST calls and parameter validation
 * object models for representing the FHIR resources
 * convenience methods for the API calls
